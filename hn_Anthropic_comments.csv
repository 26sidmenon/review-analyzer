jsprogrammer,2015-07-28T18:01:07Z,Show HN: Spot the Drowning Child,Anthropic fallacy. It seems like you are assuming a human is or will always be better than another solution.<p>There may be solutions that are vastly superior to a human lifeguard.
hyperion2010,2015-07-16T23:33:54Z,Constructor Theory Solves the Riddle of Life,"Unfortunately this seems like a rather weak tool for addressing the issue, we have had conceptually similar tools (though not attempt has really been made to formalize them) for a long time, and many border on the anthropic principle. The reason for the weakness is that there is no guidance for how "
andyjohnson0,2015-07-14T15:37:19Z,NP-Complete Problems and Physical Reality (2005),"I&#x27;m not sure if you read the paper. Aaronson writes: &quot;given a formula ϕ, guess a
random assignment x, then kill yourself if x does not satisfy ϕ.&quot; In other words, the only universes in which you find yourself existing (alive) are ones in which you are in possession of a solution to ϕ,"

I&#x27;ll definitely be reading those.<p>Aaronson&#x27;s talk on Computational Complexity and the Anthropic Principle [1] also looks interesting.<p>[1] <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scottaaronson.com&#x2F;talks&#x2F;anthropic.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scottaaronson.com&#x2F;t"
FeepingCreature,2015-07-14T11:30:54Z,NP-Complete Problems and Physical Reality (2005),"On the point of anthropic computing: it is important to note that you have not accomplished any _improvement_ to your condition by killing yourself; before as after, you had found a correct solution with probability 2^-n. Anthropic computing is just &quot;fancy guessing&quot;.<p>What is interesting "

jules,2015-06-06T12:07:55Z,A Crisis at the Edge of Physics,Note that the multiverse that this article is talking about is very different than the many worlds multiverse. The many worlds multiverse is just that the whole universe is in a quantum state. The multiverse that this article is talking about is different. Due to the expansion of space we can only s

T-A,2015-06-06T10:05:29Z,A Crisis at the Edge of Physics,"Quantum decoherence != multiverse, and the multiverse interpretation of quantum mechanics != the multiverse of cosmology mentioned in this essay.<p>The latter is a rather more concrete affair, basically saying that in regions of the universe too far away to be observable, the parameters of low energ"

drostie,2015-05-07T11:49:49Z,Why Hasn’t the World Been Destroyed in a Nuclear War Yet?,The problem is that we don&#x27;t truly believe in the strongest notions of the Anthropic principle.

MarcScott,2015-05-05T17:40:16Z,The Connection Between Color and the Existence of Life,These types of article always lead me to start pondering the strong and weak anthropic principles again. At which point I have to give up on getting any more work done as my mind goes chasing itself down the rabbit hole.
philwelch,2009-11-18T12:41:01Z,Information is Beautiful - 2012: the End of the World?,"It's kind of like the anthropic principle: of course all predictions of the end of the world have been false, otherwise we wouldn't be here."
