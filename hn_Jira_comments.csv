tracker1,2015-08-03T21:12:06Z,The Unemployable Programmer,"So, they <i>could</i> hire another senior person at 2.5x the pay instead of 3-4 junior devs.  The problem is a lot of younger managers don&#x27;t understand the different in ouput can vary a <i>lot</i> from developer to developer.  And on top of that quality output can be far more maintainable.<p>Al"

tracker1,2015-08-01T21:56:22Z,Living in Switzerland ruined me for America and its lousy work culture,"For a lot of people healthcare would be a huge expense... I&#x27;m actually pretty happy about &quot;Obamacare&quot; even though I don&#x27;t agree with the methods...

jlarocco,2015-08-01T07:26:02Z,Show HN: Crocagile – Web-based agile development tool,"Wow, rough crowd.<p>I like the interface.  It&#x27;s like a mix between Jira and Trello.  More focused than Jira, with more structure than Trello.<p>I don&#x27;t really like Jira because of its kitchen sink approach.  It tries to be everything to everybody with endless customization and options.  It"
pbreit,2015-08-01T05:58:59Z,Show HN: Crocagile – Web-based agile development tool,"Hate to say it but, it&#x27;s not very good. I can&#x27;t imagine anyone using it. At first it sounded like it might be full blown project management like Basecamp, Jira, etc. But it&#x27;s actually just really really basic To Do lists. Project&#x2F;task management is such a crucial tool for a compa"

I would make it $15 per month which includes 5 users and charge $2.50 for every extra user.<p>3) Regardless of the features you have, your product doesn&#x27;t feel polish"
BinaryIdiot,2015-07-31T02:16:54Z,GitHub Raises $250M at $2B Valuation,The most things in JIRA I need to click probably at least 5 or 6 things to do something. So I didn&#x27;t necessarily mean it&#x27;s slow as in clicking on something takes forever to load (though I&#x27;ve seen that happen on self and Atlassian hosted versions of JIRA) but that it just simply takes 
shlant,2015-07-30T16:58:55Z,GitHub Raises $250M at $2B Valuation,The only benefit I have ever seen with Bitbucket is it is priced per user instead of per repo which is only a benefit if you have smaller teams. The very first project I created for myself in my new role was to move everything out of Bitbucket to GitHub.<p>Github is so ubiquitous that it too has ver
Anderkent,2015-07-30T16:32:47Z,GitHub Raises $250M at $2B Valuation,"Devs are never excited about issue tracking, they just wanna work on things and don&#x27;t care about what others are doing most of the time. It&#x27;s project management that benefits from higher-level views that things like Jira provide."
eropple,2015-07-30T16:15:04Z,GitHub Raises $250M at $2B Valuation,"I like Jira when I have to use something that beefy, but I&#x27;ll cape up for Redmine a little bit. I find it to be super easy to hack on when I need to extend it to do what I want and it&#x27;s a pretty pleasant experience."
nathanvanfleet,2015-07-30T12:46:03Z,GitHub Raises $250M at $2B Valuation,"I feel like everyone talking about JIRA aren&#x27;t talking about the same thing. I stated strongly in a job interview that I currently used JIRA and knew it well. But was surprised that the new job didn&#x27;t set theirs up in the same was as the job before.<p>It all depends on how you set it up, b"
Grue3,2015-07-30T12:39:43Z,GitHub Raises $250M at $2B Valuation,"I prefer JIRA. I used Github issues and my current place of work uses Redmine, and neither of them are as nice to use. I like the ability to customize your dashboard to show the exact issues you&#x27;re interested in, and that you can filter them by basically everything."
otis_inf,2015-07-30T12:28:47Z,GitHub Raises $250M at $2B Valuation,"Hello, nice to meet you :) I use jira and I like it. I don&#x27;t like github issues that much in comparison because it lacks features I love in Jira, like subtasks on an issue. But YMMV of course ;)"
adamors,2015-07-30T11:16:44Z,GitHub Raises $250M at $2B Valuation,It&#x27;s really not. In the last 3 places I worked at we all used Bitbucket because their pricing is more reasonable and it integrates nicely with other Atlassian products like Jira.
jwr,2015-07-30T10:39:40Z,GitHub Raises $250M at $2B Valuation,"I can confirm there is an opening for something new. We use FogBugz (and pay quite a bit for the hosted version), because GitHub issues are too simplistic, and we hate JIRA.<p>However, FogBugz has its share of problems, and I&#x27;d gladly move to something else, if only there was something better.

davidgerard,2015-07-30T09:46:01Z,GitHub Raises $250M at $2B Valuation,"Speaking as someone who&#x27;s used bug trackers for 20 years, Jira is the closest I&#x27;ve ever seen to the mythical &quot;bug tracker that doesn&#x27;t suck too much&quot;."
mrweasel,2015-07-30T08:34:41Z,GitHub Raises $250M at $2B Valuation,"Atlassian do have products that cater to non-programmers as well, like Jira, HipChat, Confluence and some service desk application. I think Atlassian would naturally be worth more than GitHub, simply due to the larger potential user base.<p>I don&#x27;t think we know what profits either company has,"
