stevesearer,2015-08-03T21:30:18Z,Show HN: Ceremony – Wedding photos and videos from every guest,"Looks like a nice alternative to using public hashtags on instagram.<p>A couple questions off the top of my head: 1) can you join an event you haven&#x27;t been specifically invited to? 2) my wedding was at a ranch away from cell service, do you need to be connected in order to use Ceremony?"

akrymski,2015-08-03T20:10:06Z,Twitter’s stock falls toward IPO-level prices,"Twitter&#x27;s valuation is down to $19B, which is what Facebook paid for WhatsApp.  I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if Facebook would make a bid for Twitter at this price, even though FB+Insta combo seems to be killing them.<p>I can&#x27;t believe Twitter&#x27;s product people are so asleep at the whe"
volaski,2015-08-03T20:05:07Z,Twitter’s stock falls toward IPO-level prices,question: do these same people have hard time grasping what &quot;follow&quot; means on Instagram? or Tumblr? or Pinterest?
dimbirol,2015-08-03T19:30:27Z,Twitter’s stock falls toward IPO-level prices,"One thing I&#x27;ve noticed with celebrity accounts: an increasing amount of tweets is just a link to a new instagram post.<p>A tweet gets maybe a few likes and retweets, but the linked instagram post has 500 likes &amp; 25 comments within 30 minutes. That&#x27;s quite alarming!<p>e.g: <a href=""http"
AJ007,2015-08-03T18:58:43Z,Twitter’s stock falls toward IPO-level prices,"One plausible risk scenario is, under pressure, they try make significant changes without incremental testing.<p>I don&#x27;t see a good alternative channel to Twitter right now. Facebook certainly isn&#x27;t it. Instagram definitely sliced out some of Twitter&#x27;s market, but can&#x27;t do the sa"
TheOtherHobbes,2015-08-03T12:44:23Z,The Web We Have to Save,"There&#x27;s no such thing as people. There are demographics, and they all have different interests.<p>I think it&#x27;s clear there&#x27;s a huge demographic with no interest in anything beyond celebrity trivia.<p>There&#x27;s also a HN demographic, and there may even be some overlap (probably not "
jcfrei,2015-08-03T09:55:23Z,Ask HN: Do you think there will be a full replacement to Google?,"I agree. Only speaking about the search engine I could imagine that in the future Google will still  remain the dominant search engine. But search engines will be used less and less. Instead most people will use native apps and their respective search engines (facebook to search people, instagram to"

nikhilkalegregg,2015-08-03T01:55:41Z,Ask HN: Do you think there will be full replacement to Facebook?,"I think they have enough users that they don&#x27;t have to worry too much about a replacement.  Instagram is pretty close conceptually to Facebook, but most people don&#x27;t use it as a direct substitute.  One thing way in the future I could see hurting them is when my generation --the first gener"
greenyoda,2015-08-03T01:01:18Z,Ask HN: Do you think there will be full replacement to Facebook?,"It&#x27;s possible that unlike Instagram and Whatsapp, the next hot new app that&#x27;s popular with young people will be bought by a competitor of Facebook&#x27;s rather than Facebook - or will just refuse to be bought by anybody and challenge Facebook on their own terms.<p>It&#x27;s also possible "
byg80,2015-08-02T19:25:30Z,Ask HN: Do you think there will be full replacement to Facebook?,"Not anytime soon. And if there is, it will be something with most focus on mobile and phone numbers. That&#x27;s why Facebook is already on top of that with Instagram and Whatsapp. Facebook might be in this for the long haul, esp with the stuff they can also do with Oculus."
balladeer,2015-08-02T17:57:14Z,"Inside the sad, expensive failure of Google+","No, it&#x27;s that inherent non-visual (and maybe visual too) unattractiveness that killed (or is killing) G+, not it being a post-Facebook SNS. Facebook, with all its questionable practises and unquestionably appalling privacy attitude, got one thing right - it gave what users wanted and needed in "
allendoerfer,2015-08-02T16:59:02Z,"Inside the sad, expensive failure of Google+","You can replicate the network with a reduced feature-set. Be something else entirely (e.g. Whatsapp, Instagram etc.), stay lean and grow. After that you can branch out or be bought by Facebook in fear of you branching out.<p>I get your point, though.

T-A,2015-08-01T17:00:24Z,Ask HN: What was Usenet's ultimate demise?,"I thought it was just limited interest. First web hosting prices came down so much that anyone could run a forum, then WordPress made free blogging with ancillary comments accessible to anyone with a browser.
