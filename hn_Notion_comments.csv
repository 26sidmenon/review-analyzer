masswerk,2015-08-03T19:27:55Z,JavaScript is the C++ of the Web,"JS used to be a language that was easy to understand. Once you grasped the concept of how object references and scopes were handled (which everyone could who invested a few days in understanding the language and read the specs), you were able to understand any of the user-land implementations.

The fact is that you as an individual do not have the skills to out-negotiate this leviathan.&quot;<p>How so?  I own my own business now (multiple, actually).

bcg1,2015-08-03T15:31:42Z,"If we stand still, we go backwards","I agree with all of the points in this article.  Even if you believe that PPK is 100% right about the &quot;problem&quot;, I truly can&#x27;t grok the notion that a moratorium would somehow &quot;solve&quot; anything.

bmelton,2015-08-03T03:32:51Z,Ronda Rousey fights like a statistical outlier,"As much as I am defending the notion that Rousey could beat a man with which she had a good matchup, the assertion that she could beat a top male champion is indeed far-fetched.<p>As has been mentioned all over this thread, sexual dimorphism is a real thing, and not just something men made up to rep",positive,0.823
dredmorbius,2015-08-03T01:22:43Z,"Race is an illusion: a very powerful one, often fatally so","Steve S eloquently addresses the fallacies inherent in the anti-anti-racism argument.

bmelton,2015-08-02T22:30:08Z,Ronda Rousey fights like a statistical outlier,"To be fair, there are still people Royce Gracie could beat in UFC.

lordnacho,2015-08-02T20:23:13Z,Europe's Waiting Room,"The whole notion of sovereignty in its current form is an accident of European history.

thetwiceler,2015-08-02T20:10:25Z,The Banach–Tarski Paradox [video],"It seems misleading to say that intuitionistic logic assigns statements to one of the two values, True or False.

IkmoIkmo,2015-08-02T19:12:40Z,Ronda Rousey fights like a statistical outlier,"They&#x27;re both champions actually, and it&#x27;s more common for a fighter to go up than come down.

davesque,2015-08-02T18:34:55Z,The World Needs a Secular Community Revolution,"This is true, although I suspect that the reluctance to change the set of values in traditional religions may have a lot to do with subconsciously (or consciously) fearing supernatural retribution.  e.g. God will punish you for being sinful.
